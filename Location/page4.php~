<h4>Pallikaranai wetland</h4> Is a freshwater swamp in the south of the city [30]. Being able to retain water throughout the year, it forms an aquatic ecosystem. The marsh acts as a home for many endangered and as a breeding ground for thousands of migratory birds which makes it an ideal place for bird watching. A conservation project is afoot to spruce up the area and build an observation center for visitor's convenience. There have been walks conducted in the marsh by the societies like Madras Naturalists Society [31]. Contact them to find out about their events.

Similar to the above marsh, there are no regliarly conducted walks, but some photography societies and nature societies organise walks once in a while.
